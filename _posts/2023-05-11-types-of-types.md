Intro: C# types are divided into reference and value types. But then there are classes and structs. And there is Object, which is a class that everything inherits from, even not classes like Ints.
THen there are POCO classes (even these have variants), DTO classes, DDD introduces value objects and entity objects.
THere' enough different ways to define types for it make your head spin.
Compare all and draw in a single diagram on how they relate to one another.
