Lots of folks are talking about technical debt. How to reduce it? How to avoid it?
But every stick has two ends.
Have you considered what is on the other end of technical debt?

Lately I've been thinking about this. With technical debt we take out a loan on engineering effort by picking a subpar but easier solution that allows to reach the target solution faster than. We usually do this to save time. 
But other reasons might be possible as well, right?
Maybe we are opting in for a subpar solution as the proper one would require 

AHving additional engineering effort to spare and spending it on some <??> with hopes that it will pay off sounds like making a bet. You put in some money and hope to win and gain more benefit



It's like buying many subscriptions of somewhat awesome services, but you keep paying the price and the question is their utility justifies it?


## Technical bet
write about technical charity, everyone talks about technical debt, but have you wondered what is on the other end of the spectrum?
doing stuff in advance increases a chance of a bad solution, if your solution contains abstractions, remember that bad abstractions are worse long-term (maybe even short-term) that no abstractions?
Technical betting, because it is like putting in effort and not being sure if it pays off, or you just trhew away the money.
Technical charity, but it implies that this is used for something good, while in reality you might be building in vain.
Technical investing, but it has a connotation, that it's a good thing. Maybe like investing, but if it's an unknownn company, it's risky, same way it is risky to invest technical effort into problems that are mostly unknown.

lots of folks seem to be concerned with technical debt and avoiding it nowadays.
technical debt is usually acquired by opting for a subpar but easier to implement solution in order to save time. 
this can show up as simple as hardcoding some values instead of putting thenm into a configuration file, to as complex as hacking in some unplanned feature which wouldotherwise require core system redesign. The part of debt is that you have to repay it eventually, and usually with a compound interest.

So it is good and not without a reason that people are eager to make things right from the first try.
but have you thought about what lies on the other side of the spectrum from technical debt?
imagine an eager engineer throbbing with knowledge of new tools, interesting architectural patterns and a bag of good practices.
now imagine a semi-simple but not so well defined problem that is causing problems for lots of people amd our engineer is tasked to attempt to solve it.
there is time pressure, but our engineer is pushover and strives to build software without technical debt.
so he embarks on a design journey to apply some of the shiny tools, to fit in some architectural and design patterns.
basically what could happen is we get to the point where we apply good practices and engineering patterns for the sole fear of technical debt.
we start putting in technical effort to create solutions that are way too overqualified for the problems that we are solving. 
in other words,instead of borrowing technical effort to save time, we give away technical effort and the time it translated into.
and when the problem or task at hand does not require such technical effort, we are essentially wasting it, or at least hoping that 
the effort we put in now "might" pay off in the future when we might want to do and extension to the current problem, maybe add new features
or modify existingones.
what we are doing is technical betting.
we put in time and techincal effort with hopes that we madea right decision and we will win back our bet and thensome.
the truth is we cannot see in the future. so betting or gambling is all this is.
unfortunately I have seen a lot of technical betting lately.
